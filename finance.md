## Stock Trend Prediction with Multi-Granularity Data: A Contrastive Learning Approach with Adaptive Fusion
1. Multi-granularity
2. Cross-Granularity and Cross-Temporal **contrast learning**

## Stock Selection via Spatiotemporal Hypergraph Attention Network: A Learning to Rank Approach
1. Modeling **relations** between related stocks' temporal price movement
2. Using profitable metrics and NDCG for ranking
3. Using Hawkes process as temporal attention

## Stock market forecasting using a multi-task approach integrating long short-term memory and the random forest framework
CCF None
+ An awesome table (table 1) Describes 43 technical indicators.

## Relation-aware dynamic attributed graph attention network for stocks recommendation
Using normalized Mutual Information as relations?

## NumHTML: Numeric-Oriented Hierarchical Transformer Model for Multi-task Financial Forecasting
1. d
2. Multi-task

## Robust Dual Recurrent Neural Networks for Financial Time Series Prediction
1. Classify noise-free samples and noisy samples
2. Cross-updating inspired bt co-training to overcome **sample-selection bias**

## Multi-scale Two-way Deep Neural Network for Stock Trend Prediction
1. Considering 2 different scale behavior by wavelet-based XGBoost and down-sampling-based RCNN
2. Datasets: FI-2010 and CSI-2016

## Long-term, Short-term and Sudden Event: Trading Volume Movement Prediction with Graph-based Multi-view Modeling
+ valuable target for further study
1. Predict trading volume instead of price
2. Emphasis on multi-view information, including long-term stock relation, short-term fluctuations and sudden events

## Learning Multiple Stock Trading Patterns with Temporal Routing Adaptor and Optimal Transport
+ model multiple stock trading patterns
1. the lack of explicit identifiers makes it quite challenging to train a router. So they design a learning algorithm based on Optimal Transport
